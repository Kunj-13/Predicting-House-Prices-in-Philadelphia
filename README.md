Machine Learning Project: Predicting House Prices in Philadelphia

# Data Collection
In the initial stages of my machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices in Philadelphia, I started with the data collection and preprocessing phases. For data collection, I compiled a dataset from real estate websites, public databases, and APIs, ensuring it included a diverse range of house characteristics such as location, size, and other relevant features. This dataset comprised over 5,000 entries, which I believed would be sufficient for developing a robust model.
